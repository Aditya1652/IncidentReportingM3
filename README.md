# IncidentReportingM3

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.12.

### **Task 2: Incident Reporting Tool**
Add this to your readme file.

#### **Story:**

You are tasked with developing an **Incident Reporting Tool** using **Angular** for the front end and **Firebase** for backend services. The application is designed to streamline the reporting and resolution of incidents within an organization, ensuring efficient role-based workflows.

---

### **Story Flow**

#### **1. Project Setup (10%)**

- Use Angular as the front-end framework and Firebase for authentication, Firestore as the database, and Firebase Hosting for deployment.  
- Configure Firebase services to handle authentication and real-time data synchronization.  
- Install a UI library of your choice (Angular Material, Tailwind CSS, or Ionic) for styling and UI components.  

---

#### **2. Authentication & Authorization (15%)**

- **Login Scenarios:**  
  1. **Scenario 1:** A user logs in with their mobile number and receives an OTP. After entering the correct OTP, they are directed to their dashboard based on their role (Admin or Reporter).  
  2. **Scenario 2:** A user logs in with an invalid OTP, and an error message is displayed.   

- **Auth Guards:**  
  - Protect admin routes like **incident assignment and resolution**.  
  - Restrict reporters to their own incident reports.  

---

#### **3. User Interface (15%)**

- **Admin UI Features:**  
  - Dashboard: Displays all incidents categorized by status (Open, In Progress, Resolved).  
  - Forms for assigning incidents to reporters and marking incidents as resolved.  
  - List of reporters with their assigned incidents.  

- **Reporter UI Features:**  
  - Dashboard: Displays incidents reported by them with details like description, priority, and status.  
  - Ability to update the status of incidents (e.g., "In Progress") and add comments.  

- **UI Expectations:**  
  - Use a clean and responsive design.  
  - Include visual indicators for incident priority (e.g., Low, Medium, High).  

---

#### **4. Problem Solving (15%)**

- Implement logic for **incident reporting and tracking**:  
  - Admins can view all incidents and assign them to reporters.  
  - Reporters can update incident statuses and add resolution comments.  

- **Edge Case Handling:**  
  - Prevent duplicate incident reports by validating the description and reporter information.  
  - Ensure reporters cannot edit or delete incidents assigned to others.  

---

#### **5. Role-Based CRUD Operations (10%)**

- Admins can:  
  - Create, view, and assign incidents.  
  - Resolve incidents.  

- Reporters can:  
  - Report new incidents.  
  - Update the status and add comments to their assigned incidents.  

---

#### **6. Angular & TypeScript Concepts (10%)**

- **Services:** Create `IncidentService` and `AuthService` for managing incidents and authentication.  
- **Interfaces:** Define `Incident` and `User` interfaces for strongly typed data models.  
- **Lifecycle Hooks:** Use `ngOnInit` to fetch incidents and users.  
- **Pipes:** Create a custom pipe to filter incidents by priority or status.  

---

#### **7. Coding Standards (10%)**

- Follow Osmosys Angular standards for:  
  - Modular structure: Separate modules for authentication and incident management.  
  - Consistent naming conventions.  
  - Clear and concise comments for code readability.  

---

#### **8. Code Quality (5%)**

- Focus on reusability:  
  - Use shared components for incident cards and forms.  
  - Implement reusable validation logic for forms.  

---

#### **9. Deployment & Submission (10%)**

- Deploy the application using Firebase Hosting.  
- Use Git for version control with regular commits and well-written commit messages.  
- Submit the project by pushing the code to a GitHub repository.

By adhering to these guidelines and evaluation criteria, developers can demonstrate their competency in Angular development, Firebase integration, and project management.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
